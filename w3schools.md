## Strings
Reading the chapter was a nice review and summery on commands we have used already.
I find the sub-chapters "escape characters" and "string methods" especially useful to use as a cheetsheet, when you can't remember a command.\
The exercises were a bit harder than I thought, and I was reminded to read the tasks carefully. At exercise 4 I wanted to use ```txt[1:-1]```, but using ```txt.strip()``` was the 
answer. It was the same result, but I get why ```.strip()``` would be the better option!

## Lists
The first part was very similar to the strings one. I found the "change list items" sub-chapter interesting, especially about changeing more than one item. 
The while-loop was new to me. I found "list comprehension" a bit confusing, I think a for-loop is easier to read and understand when working with an existing list. 
I get why it van be useful tho. Again I foung "list methods" very useful.\
The exercises were quite quick and easy to solve.

## If-Statements
This was a revision as well, although I didn't know about ```elif```. I don't like the suggestion to put everything in one line it there is only one statement tho, 
to me this makes it harder to read. I also found pass interesting, even if I can't really think of a good use-case.\
For the exercises I was very glad to be reminded to use a colon. They were quite easy, but i still very much do not like the short-hand-option.

## For-Loops
Again mostly a revision, but I found ```break``` and ```continue``` insteresting.
The exercises again were quite easy.

**Overall I really liked w3schools!**
